	- Search by ID if the ID is enterted
	- Search by phone if the phone is enterted
	- Standard Search if the phone and ID is not enterted
	
2. Search validations are accordingly to search functions

=> Using factory design pattern to write implementation code.
=> Using strategy pattern to wrap the escapsulated valition impl into the search class type.
